Bytes module for nginx.

This module was designed to allow easy access to range of file data.  It
searches request arguments for 'bytes=...' and return requested range.  All
requested data is returned concatinated in single reply, with apropriate
Content-Length set.

All of the above allows to do nasty things with regular files and even
proxied replies, including things like flv streaming.  E.g. one may use
something like this instead of flv module:

    location /video/ {
        bytes on;
        if ($args ~ "start=(\d+)") {
            set  $args  "bytes=0-12,$1-";
        }
    }

Argument bytes= must contain range specification as defined in RFC 2616,
"14.35.1 Byte Ranges", with the following exceptions:

    1. Whitespaces aren't permitted.

    1. Ranges must not overlap and must be monothonic.  E.g. something
       like "bytes=10-20,0-10" isn't premitted.

To compile nginx with bytes module, use "--add-module <path>" option to nginx
configure.
